# about
a final Project summarizing our study of scss and html over at INT college.
this project is a mimic of a sigma template, while keeping after certein criteria.

## for tal (our mentor):
im yet to finish the 3rd page, fixing things that should not be conventional (like the svss), and improving readabilty overall before the deadline,
and that was due to personal matters (which are somewhat related to the reason i coouldnt come to the lesson of the time).
I enjoyed the project and I might just finish it at my own time, but an opprotunity to re-astablish a deadline would be apretiated.
if you have any furthermore questions ill *probably* be avialable over at slack and whatsapp.
