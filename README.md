# about
a final Project summarizing our study of SCSS and HTML over at INT College.
this project is a mimic of a Sigma template, while keeping after certain criteria.

## for Tal (our mentor):
I'm yet to finish the 3rd page, fixing things that should not be conventional (like the SVGs), and improving readability overall before the deadline,
and that was due to personal matters (which are somewhat related to the reason I couldn't come to the lesson at the time).
I enjoyed the project and I might just finish it on my own time, but an opportunity to re-establish a deadline would be appreciated.
if you have any furthermore questions ill *probably* be available over at Slack and WhatsApp.
